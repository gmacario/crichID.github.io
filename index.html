<h4>The Problem</h4>

<p>We all want to be the best in our field, but what exactly does that mean? Let me give you an example of the pattern I see repeated time and time again in the instructional design and training world.</p>


<p>A certain instructional designer, let's call him Tom, is brilliant. He creates a course on Occupational Health and Safety that has learners on the edge of their seats. Post-course evaluations hail him as a modern day hero - but only a few people outside of his own company even know his name.</p>

<p>Tom's boss, we will call him Boss Man, knows the value of networking and wants to be known for his organization's amazing training.</p>

<p>So Tom and Boss Man write a white paper, maybe they even give a conference talk. They talk about the theories and principles behind what they did - you know, adult learners like to be engaged and they like pretty pictures. Which we all knew already, but maybe we just needed a reminder so we can be more like Tom?</p>

<p>Hundreds of instructional designers around the world read the paper and attend the talks, and then they all go back and spend hundreds of thousands of hours trying to "be like Tom". Few will succeed - most will re-iterate on the same boring training they created last time.</p>

<p>We are supposed to be performance improvement <i>professionals</i> - surely we can come up with a better way ...</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Root of the Problem</h3>

<p>Why does this pattern repeat over and over again in the training world? Why are we so afraid to share our work openly with others? Here are some of the excuses I have heard over the years:</p>

<h4>My Work is My IP (or My Company's IP)</h4>

<p>I have written enough training to tell you this is a weak argument at best. The amount of true IP in a course on <i>Preventing Healthcare Fraud</i> (and millions of others like it) is negligible at best. Most of the content in these courses comes from the guidance and documentation provided in support of the laws themselves - or from research conducted in a handful of academic studies. You could easily replace sections of IP with placeholders and share your brilliance with the world.</p>

<h4>My Work isn't Good Enough</h4>

<p>Yes it is! The fact you are willing to start the conversation is proof that it is good enough. More on this later ...</p>

<h4>It Takes Too Much Time</h4>

<p>The time you spend open sourcing content is easily returned when you are able to use someone else's content.</p>

<h4>But I Make My Living Writing Training</h4>

<p>We all do. What better way to demonstrate your capabilities and build trust with potential clients then to point to your expert contributions on open source projects.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Forming a Solution</h3>

<p>First and foremost, we need to understand what this open source thing is all about. The truth is - open source has been a mainstay in the technology industry for years. Major software companies have entire divisions dedicated to open source. Here are a few names you may recognize:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.github.io">twitter.github.io</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://microsoft.github.io">microsoft.github.io</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://code.facebook.com">code.facebook.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Open source is not about taking everything you write and putting it online. It is about taking the helpful parts and making them available to others. People contribute to open source because they want to be known as the best or they want to learn from the best. They want to help advance their profession. They want to give back. Because they crave collaboration with like minded individuals. The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Open source is also not about posting a PDF of your PPT and saying "look but don't touch". It is about sharing assets that are reusable. Take examples like the <a href="https://github.com/pipwerks/scorm-api-wrapper">Pipwerks SCORM API Wrapper</a> by Philip Hutchinson. I can't tell you how happy I am that Philip was kind enough to open source his awesome work - he saved me hours and hours of work when I first started in eLearning development.</p>

<p>Launching an open source movement will not be easy! It will take some time and a small legion of willing contributors to build a library of useful content. What do you say? Will you join me?</p>
